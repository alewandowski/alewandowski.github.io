I work downtown and there are lots of really good places to eat, in particular, food carts.  As a terrible cook and adult, I eat out for lunch more than I should, but it gives me a chance to try all the carts in the area.  A couple weeks ago, I went to one called Mama Chows.  

I was served by papa chow.
