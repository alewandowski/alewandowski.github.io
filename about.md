### Hello and welcome to Yum Yum in my Tum Tum.  A food blog that's not really about food.  

Alex, Connor and I started this blog to write about our lives and the food we eat.

For those of you who stumbled on this some other way, we're three recent grads who live in Portland, OR and eat out every now and then.  Typically we write about places we go, but in Connor and Alex's case, they can cook something worth writing about at home.  I just eat.

This isn't a normal food blog.  We can't actually write anything useful about food.  We just write about our lives through food which to us, is what eating is all about.  Food isn't just about the food.  It's about the whole experience.  Your cravings, how your day is going, the people, the ambiance, whether or not you've called your parents recently.

Our goal is to write about that - our stories, our adventures, and our lives, through food.

Cheers, <br/>
Connor, Alex and Reid
