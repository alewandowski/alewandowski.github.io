We’re like good breakfast.  Our drive back from Vancouver was no exception.

### Portage Bay

On our way back from Vancouver, we stopped in Seattle for breakfast with some good friends.  I’m not from Seattle, but apparently this place is the place to eat breakfast if you know anything.  Personally I think the name is a little weird.  Makes me think of fish and oysters.

### Really Really Really Good Breakfast

Here’s a picture of Alex’s french toast.  I had the corn beef hash.  A good way to describe these plates is this.  Anyone can make a decent breakfast.  We all have that friend who “doesn’t really eat breakfast” and thinks its the easiest meal of the day to get right.  First off, don’t be their friend.  Secondly, when you put a little time and love into it, breakfast can be absolutely spectacular.  That’s what this place was.  People who know go a little further to make breakfast that great morning sex that gets you off to an excellent day.
