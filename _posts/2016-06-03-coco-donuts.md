It was nearly 100 degrees out for national donut day.  We didn't let the heat slow us down.

### Pro-tip: places run out of donuts early on national donut day.

Our little escapade started with a bit of a drive out to Annie's donuts in NE way down Sandy Blvd.  Unfortunately, that place was closed.  Who eats donuts on national donut day anyways?  After failing there, we drove to one of the Coco Donuts locations in NE.  I called first to make sure they had a few donuts left.  The person working there seemed a little curious as to why the hell you would call a donut shop asking if they had donuts, but after explaining our predicament she understood.  So after another uncomfortably sweaty car ride, we finally had a donut.

### The chocolate one with peanuts.

I had a chocolate donut with peanuts that was absolutely delicious.  Not fresh out of the oven, but paired with an iced americano (the national donut day rush cleared them out of the normal stuff) on a 100+ degree day, it was a treat.  The donuts have a little crunch to them that gives a nice texture and makes them a little more interesting.

There was something special about the dough for this one but I'm blanking on it now.  It was also delicious.  Alex and Connor (pictured above) had one.  A classic no nonsense chocolate donut.  They don't make them like that anymore.
