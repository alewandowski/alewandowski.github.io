In the last four years that Reid, Connor and I have known each other we have eaten together countless times. From the late night munchies in our sophomore dungeon of a dorm room to indulging at restaurants that are blatantly out of our price range, it’s safe to say that our food history together is a colorful one. Our shared appreciation for well-made food always gave us something to bond over. With that in mind, a couple of weeks ago the three of us got to talking and decided we should write down our gastronomic experiences. We don’t always eat together but by sharing our stories with our readers we can open up a window into our day to day lives, whether that may be Doritos and French onion dip or Fish Sauce wings at Pok Pok.

Just in time for us to make the blog I decided to take a trip home. By no means does that mean dreary food for me (quite the opposite actually, but that’s for another post) but it just drained my motivation to get started. So when I got back to Portland, the city’s food scene was calling my name. It was time to resume my quest to find the Portland area’s best breakfast. I am not particularly interested in crowning one as breakfast royalty, I simply want to explore the ends of the Portland breakfast world.
